# Bookface Lab  

One of my very first lessons at Redwood Code Academy that involved coding a simple webpage using HTML and CSS. This was my code from this very first lesson. 

## npm install http-server -g 

After installing we can go to our static site directory and can run

## http-server

It will serve the directory on localhost 8080 by default.
